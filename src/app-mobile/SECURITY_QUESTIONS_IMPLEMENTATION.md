# 🔐 Security Questions Flow - Implementation Summary

## ✅ **Task Completed Successfully**

I've successfully created a comprehensive security questions flow with two new screens that allow users to answer their selected security questions in a clean, accessible, and user-friendly manner.

## 🎯 **What Was Implemented**

### 📱 **New Screens Created**

#### 1. **RegistrationStep2AScreen.tsx**
- **Purpose**: Handles the first half of selected security questions
- **Features**:
  - Clean, card-based UI for each question
  - Multiline TextInput for answers
  - Progress tracking (50% completion)
  - Real-time validation
  - Accessibility support
  - Consistent styling with the app theme

#### 2. **RegistrationStep2BScreen.tsx**
- **Purpose**: Handles the second half of selected security questions
- **Features**:
  - Same clean UI as Step 2A
  - Progress tracking (75% completion)
  - Summary card showing all selected questions
  - Confirmation dialog before submission
  - Final validation before proceeding

### 🔄 **Navigation Flow Updated**

#### **Updated RegistrationStep2Screen.tsx**
- Modified `handleNext()` to navigate to `RegistrationStep2A` instead of directly to `RegistrationStep3`
- Passes selected question objects and empty answers object to the first answer screen

#### **Updated AppNavigator.tsx**
- Added imports for both new screens
- Added navigation routes:
  - `RegistrationStep2A` - "Perguntas de Segurança - Parte 1"
  - `RegistrationStep2B` - "Perguntas de Segurança - Parte 2"

#### **Updated RegistrationStep3Screen.tsx**
- Added support for receiving security answers via route parameters
- Added logging of security answers (for debugging)
- Maintains existing investment profile selection functionality

## 🎨 **UI/UX Features**

### **Visual Design**
- **Consistent Styling**: Matches the existing app design system
- **Card-Based Layout**: Each question is presented in a clean card
- **Progress Indicators**: Clear progress bars showing completion status
- **Icon Integration**: Each question displays its associated icon
- **Color Coding**: Primary color theming throughout

### **User Experience**
- **Split Questions**: Questions are evenly distributed between two screens
- **Real-Time Validation**: Users can't proceed without answering all questions
- **Progress Tracking**: Shows completion status (e.g., "Respondidas: 1/2")
- **Confirmation Dialog**: Final confirmation before submission
- **Back Navigation**: Users can go back to review/change answers

### **Accessibility**
- **Screen Reader Support**: Proper `accessibilityLabel` and `accessibilityHint`
- **Touch Targets**: Adequate touch areas for all interactive elements
- **High Contrast**: Maintains good color contrast ratios
- **Semantic Structure**: Proper heading hierarchy and labels

## 🔧 **Technical Implementation**

### **State Management**
```typescript
// Question answers are managed in local state
const [questionAnswers, setQuestionAnswers] = useState<{ [key: number]: string }>(answers);

// Answers are passed between screens via navigation parameters
navigation.navigate('RegistrationStep2A', {
  selectedQuestions: selectedQuestionObjects,
  answers: {}
});
```

### **Data Flow**
1. **RegistrationStep2** → User selects 2 questions
2. **RegistrationStep2A** → User answers first half of questions
3. **RegistrationStep2B** → User answers second half of questions
4. **RegistrationStep3** → User selects investment profile (with security answers)

### **Validation Logic**
```typescript
// Validates that all questions in current screen are answered
const unansweredQuestions = firstHalfQuestions.filter(
  question => !questionAnswers[question.id]?.trim()
);

if (unansweredQuestions.length > 0) {
  Alert.alert('Perguntas não respondidas', 'Por favor, responda todas as perguntas...');
  return;
}
```

## 📱 **Screen Features Breakdown**

### **RegistrationStep2AScreen**
- **Header**: Back button, title, progress bar (50%)
- **Content**: Title section with info box, question cards
- **Questions**: First half of selected questions with TextInput

### **RegistrationStep2BScreen**
- **Header**: Back button, title, progress bar (75%)
- **Content**: Title section with success info box, question cards
- **Questions**: Second half of selected questions with TextInput

- ✅ **Validation Feedback**: Immediate feedback on completion status
- ✅ **Confirmation Step**: Final review before submission

### **Technical Benefits**
